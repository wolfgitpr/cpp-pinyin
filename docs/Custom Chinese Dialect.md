# Custom Chinese Dialect

## Make Custom Dict

[pinyin-makedict](https://github.com/wolfgitpr/pinyin-makedict) is the tool for creating custom dialect dictionaries.

## Create a derived class

Put the dictionary generated by the previous project into the [res/dict](../res/dict) folder, with the folder name inheriting the id passed
in from the ChineseG2p class, and manually create user_dict.txt.

Inherit [ToneCoverter](../include/cpp-pinyin/ToneConverter.h) class, declare Pinyin Style and implement corresponding
conversion function, refer to [ManTone.h](../include/cpp-pinyin/ManTone.h).

Inherit the ChineseG2p class, initialize the converter in the constructor, and override interfaces such as
hanziToPinyin (usually only requiring modification of default parameters), refer
to [Pinyin.h](../include/cpp-pinyin/Pinyin.h).
